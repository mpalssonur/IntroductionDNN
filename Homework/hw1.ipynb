    "## Predicting Housing Prices in Iceland (100 points)\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, you will build models to predict housing prices in Iceland using real-world data from the Icelandic National Registry.\n",
    "\n",
    "Such models are useful for:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Economists and policymakers** who want to understand which factors drive housing prices (especially if the models are interpretable).\n",
    "* **Investors** who want to identify undervalued or overvalued properties.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset is based on registered sales contracts (*þinglýstir kaupsamningar*) and includes information such as sales price, location, size, and more.\n",
    "Download it here: [kaupskrá fasteigna](https://www.skra.is/gogn/grunngogn-til-nidurhals/kaupskra-fasteigna/).\n",
    "\n",
    "⚠️ Notes about the data:\n",
    "\n",
    "* It has relatively **few features**, which may make high accuracy difficult.\n",
    "* Prices have increased sharply over time, so try to account for inflation somehow.\n",
    "* Restricting the dataset to a single type of property is allowed.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Tasks\n",
    "\n",
    "### a) Data exploration (10 points)\n",
    "\n",
    "* Use **scatter plots** and **histograms** to explore the data.\n",
    "* Identify missing values, correlated features, and outliers.\n",
    "* Based on your analysis, create a **feature set** to use in your model.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### b) Baseline linear model (10 points)\n",
    "\n",
    "* Split the dataset into training and test sets, where the **test set = years 2024 and 2025**.\n",
    "* Train a **linear regression model** (least squares loss) on your feature set.\n",
    "* Evaluate the model with one or more performance measures (see notes below).\n",
    "* Which features turned out to be useful? Which did not?\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### c) Alternative loss functions (10 points)\n",
    "\n",
    "* Try a different loss function (e.g. mean absolute deviation, Huber, logcosh).\n",
    "* Does this improve performance?\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### e) Advanced model: AutoGluon (20 points)\n",
    "\n",
    "* Try using **AutoGluon** ([GitHub link](https://github.com/autogluon/autogluon)).\n",
    "* Compare results with linear regression.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### d) Advanced model: TabPFN (20 points)\n",
    "\n",
    "* Try using **TabPFN**, a foundation model for tabular data.\n",
    "* Example Colab notebook: [TabPFN Demo](https://colab.research.google.com/github/PriorLabs/TabPFN/blob/main/examples/notebooks/TabPFN_Demo_Local.ipynb).\n",
    "* Optional background reading: [Nature paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-08328-6).\n",
    "* Compare its performance to your linear model and TabPFN.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### f) Learning curves (20 points)\n",
    "\n",
    "* Plot a **learning curve** comparing all models (linear regression, TabPFN, AutoGluon).\n",
    "* Train them with different amounts of data.\n",
    "* Do the models’ performances **saturate** as you add more data?\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### g) Further improvements (10 points)\n",
    "\n",
    "* Experiment with other techniques (e.g. feature engineering, transformations, handling categorical variables, better scaling).\n",
    "* Report any improvements.\n",
    "\n",

    "## Notes & Tips\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The **Icelandic housing price index** may help correct for inflation: [link](https://hms.is/gogn-og-maelabord/visitolur).\n",
    "2. You may need to **manually adjust the dataset** to load it into pandas.\n",
    "3. Carefully inspect the data: outliers, incorrect formatting, missing values, and scaling can all harm your models.\n",
    "\n",
    "   > *Remember: garbage in → garbage out.*\n",
    "4. Useful performance metrics:\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Mean squared error (MSE)\n",
    "   * Mean absolute deviation (MAD)\n",
    "   * \\$R^2\\$ coefficient\n",
    "5. Consider categorical variables — do they need encoding?\n",
    "6. Nonlinear transformations of variables may help.\n",
    "7. Example code for L1 (MAD) regression: [StackOverflow link](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/51883058/l1-norm-instead-of-l2-norm-for-cost-function-in-regression-model).\n",
    "8. Diagnostic plots:\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Plot **\\$y\\_{\\text{true}}\\$ vs. \\$y\\_{\\text{pred}}\\$**.\n",
    "   * Plot a histogram of **errors (\\$y\\_{\\text{true}} - y\\_{\\text{pred}}\\$)**.\n",
    "9. Alternative loss functions: MAD, Huber, logcosh (see code snippet provided).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
